Since iSCSI is typically implemented in a different subnet than management and other traffic, it's common to assign a separate subnet for iSCSI communication.\n\nTo create a separate subnet for iSCSI-A, we can use the same IP address range but modify the subnet mask to give us a larger number of hosts or to exclude specific IP addresses used for other purposes. Since no IP gateway is mentioned and there's no requirement for routing in this context, a /23 subnet might be an appropriate choice (192.168.10.0/23) as it provides 520 hosts (more than enough for most iSCSI implementations). But the actual implementation depends on the specific network design and requirements.\n\nSo, without knowing the exact subnet chosen, we cannot definitively answer with a single subnet.
