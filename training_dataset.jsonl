However, this configuration actually increases the risk of data leakage between different VLANs instead of keeping them separated.\n\nThis is because when using a non-default native VLAN, devices on other VLANs must be explicitly configured to send and receive traffic on that VLAN. In contrast, devices in the default native VLAN do not require any special configuration for interoperability with other trunked devices. Thus, if a misconfiguration occurs, devices on unintended VLANs may end up sending and receiving traffic intended for the native VLAN, leading to potential security vulnerabilities or data leakage.\n\nIt is generally recommended to use the default native VLAN (VLAN 1) in trunk links whenever possible and appropriate to minimize these risks. However, if there are specific reasons for using a non-default native VLAN, it is crucial to ensure that all devices involved in the trunk link are properly configured and secured to prevent unintended data leakage or security vulnerabilities."}
