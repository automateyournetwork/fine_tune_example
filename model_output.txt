What is the IP subnet used for VLAN ID 1022 in the FlexPod environment? Please provide a direct answer.

The IP subnet used for VLAN ID 10:22 (which is not a valid VLAN ID, by the way) is not specified in FlexPod documentation. 

However, if you're looking for information on VLAN addressing and IP subnets in general, here's a general guideline:

In Cisco-based networks like FlexPod, VLANs are identified by a unique 16-bit identifier (VLAN ID), which can range from 0 to 4094.

For example, VLAN ID 10:22 is not a valid VLAN ID. The correct format for a VLAN ID is an 802.1Q or IEEE 802.3 standard VLAN identifier, which consists of two parts:

- The first part is the VLAN ID (VID), which can range from 0 to 4094.
- The second part is the priority code point (PCP), which can be either 0000 or 1110.

VLANs are typically identified by their VID only. 

IP subnets, on the other hand, are used for IPv4 and IPv6 addressing. They define a contiguous block of IP addresses that can be assigned to devices on a network. For example:

- The subnet mask (also known as the CIDR notation) is used to determine which part of an IP address belongs to the subnet and which part identifies the device.

Please note that VLAN ID 10:22 is not a valid VLAN ID, and it's important to follow standard formatting guidelines for VLAN IDs.
